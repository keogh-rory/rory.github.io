Rory's small "portfolio" comprised of two mini games built in java in his spare time.
This "portfolio" is intended to supplement my application to Shopify's Dev-Degree.

Instructions for use:

Both java programs can be dowloaded, compiled, and ran. When Run, some instructions to follow are:

JavaJack.java:
At the beginning the user will be prompted to select a menu option, they should enter a number from 1-3 to select a menu, in other parts of the program they will be asked a yes or no question and should enter y for yes or n for no (the user will be prompted for this dilemma, with this symbol y/n). Finally, the user will be asked if they want to hit or stick on their hand, they should enter 1 to hit and 2 to stick as directed by the program.

JavaTicTacToe.java:
At the beginning of this program the user will be met with an ASCII tic tac toe board. The computer will place a peg first followed by the user. When entering a peg position, you should select an unnocupied position. The first line of input should be your the row you wish to place--a number between a and c--and the second line of input should be your expected collumn--a number between 1 and 3.
